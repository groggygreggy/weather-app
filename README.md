# weather-app

Used the OpenWeatherMap API to build a weather app from scratch. I used the GeoCoding API to find the latitude and longitude of the user's city input, then returned weather information by using the latitude and longitude data.

#second commit
1. I drafed the design of the app and wrote the CSS for the first page. Included layout, designing the radio buttons for the unit selectors, and more.
2. Added logic to the search function so that the user would be prompted to re-enter the cityif an invalid city was entered.
3. Added unit logic - user can specify whether they want the results in imperial units or metric units.
4. Added logic to the search function so that if the user searched without specifying the unit, they would be asked to select a unit.
